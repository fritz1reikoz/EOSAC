<h1>Enhancing Organizational Security Awareness Campaign</h1>

<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
I started and oversaw a creative Security Awareness Campaign as an entry-level Security Analyst with the goal of strengthening the organization's security posture and notably lowering security occurrences. The main objectives of this extensive program, which was painstakingly designed and carried out, were to reduce human error and raise employee understanding of cybersecurity in general.

<h2>Project Objectives:</h2>
- Inform people about how the panorama of cybersecurity threats is changing.
- Inform workers about information security best practices.
- Minimize security events brought on by mistakes made by people.
- Encourage a culture of accountability and attention for data security.
